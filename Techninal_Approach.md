Technical Approach

The recommendation system uses a combination of content-based filtering and collaborative filtering:
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Each place is represented as a feature vector derived from its attributes (e.g., location, type).
- **Collaborative Filtering**: User-item interactions are analyzed using cosine similarity to generate recommendations for similar users.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Scores from both approaches are combined to rank recommendations.

Sparsity in the user-item matrix is addressed by normalizing interactions and using cosine similarity to calculate similarities.
